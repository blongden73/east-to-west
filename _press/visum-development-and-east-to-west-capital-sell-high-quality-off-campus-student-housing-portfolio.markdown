Content text: "MIAMI (June 17, 2021)—Ithaca-based Visum Development Group LLC and
  its equity partners, including UK real estate private equity firm East To West Capital,
  today announced they have sold The Lux and The Lofts, two top-tier student housing
  complexes comprised of 281 beds located next to Cornell University in Ithaca, NY
  to Harrison Street, one of the leading investment management firms exclusively focused
  on alternative real assets.\n\n> “Ithaca, New York and Cornell University represent
  one of the most attractive student housing markets in the country from a supply
  and demand perspective,” said Andrea Cassandro, Managing Partner, East To West Capital.
  “This market characteristic is made possible by the great demand and the barriers
  to entry that exist for new development.”\n\nChristopher Merrill, Harrison Street’s
  Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “These are well managed,
  highly desirable student accommodations serving one of the nation’s most prestigious
  universities in Cornell.  Ithaca is a phenomenal, growing college town but access
  to new developments is scarce.  We are pleased to have acquired these assets and
  support these exceptional student accommodations designed to facilitate and enhance
  the university experience for Cornell students.”\n\nThe Lux (pictured above left),
  located at 112-114 Summit Avenue in Ithaca, is a 207-bed development completed in
  2018. The Lux consists of two, four-story buildings. The complex offers 10 different
  floorplans ranging from one- to five-bedroom units.\nThe Lofts (pictured above right),
  located at 201 College Avenue in Ithaca, is a 74-bed development completed in 2017.
  The Lofts consist of one five-story building. The complex offers four different
  floorplans ranging from one- to four-bedroom units.\nAt the time of acquisition,
  each development maintained a 95 percent occupancy rate. \n\n“We’ve overachieved
  the investment goals that have guided the initial development and ongoing management
  of these complexes,” Cassandro added. \n\nCassandro attributes that to the development
  partner, Todd Fox of Visum Development Group. Fox, based in Ithaca, has demonstrated
  impressive handling of local municipal approvals and expert execution with on-time
  and on-budget construction. Both buildings have overperformed the initial business
  plan.\n\n“With interest rates remaining low and the impacts of COVID more fully
  understood, now was an appropriate time to sell,” stated Fox. “This asset has performed
  well since we developed it and should remain one of the premier student housing
  properties in Ithaca.” \nBoth The Lux and The Lofts offer fully furnished apartments
  equipped with an eat-in kitchen with bar stools, stainless steel appliances, quartz
  countertops, glass tile backsplashes, a microwave and dishwasher. Units also feature
  a stackable washer/dryer ensemble and mounted smart TV with Roku. Heat, air-conditioning,
  and Wi-Fi are included. Some units offer private balconies.\n\nCommunity amenities
  at The Lux, which is located in the heart of Collegetown, include a rooftop terrace
  with panoramic skyline vistas, outdoor fire pit lounge, fitness center, sauna and
  steam room, indoor      bicycle storage, resident lounge/smart TV, game room, package
  rooms, and study rooms. Community amenities at The Lofts include a media lounge,
  luxury fitness center, and controlled access.\n\nJ. Ryan Lang, Vice Chairman, and
  Ben Harkrider, Transaction Manager, of the Multifamily Capital Markets division
  of NEWMARK, were the exclusive marketing representatives for Visum Development and
  East To West Capital. NEWMARK also represented Harrison Street in this off-market
  transaction.\n\n### About East To West Capital\nEast To West Capital is an independent
