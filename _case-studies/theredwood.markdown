Intro: SEATTLE MICRO-UNIT MULTI FAMILY RENTAL (PRS) PROJECT
Stat: 308% | PROFIT ON $1.7M EQUITY INVESTED
Strategy Description: |-
  Affordability achieved through focusing on location and proximity to employment and entertainment hubs by delivering a size of unit that was 30% cheaper than the marketplace at the time of construction.

  Project did not contain any amenities other than a communal roof-deck, this was critical in enabling expense costs to be low and a maximum value per sq ft earnt in revenue. Crucially, the site had no parking requirement from the city which kept costs down.
Success Description: |-
  As the property was readied for market, a Japanese funded buyer bought the property before its launch for $17.5m.

  Upon opening, rents were able to be increased due to demand from an average of $1050 pcm to $1450 pcm.

  The sale was a record price per sq ft paid for a multifamily property in the Seattle market at $918 per sq ft.

  The same buyer also bought our Portland micro-unit project at the same time.
