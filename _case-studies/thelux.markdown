Intro: STUDENT HOUSING
Stat: 181% | PROFIT ON EQUITY
Strategy Description: |-
  After identifying student housing as a niche investment opportunity, we decided to specialise in top-tier, high-demand universities located in parts of the USA that are difficult to gain planning permission in, restricting supply and preserving value long term. Ivy League university in Ithaca Upstate New York is one such market.

  We selected an experienced local developer for a 230-bed project at the main entrance to Cornell University, in a unique generational location.

  We funded $2m in equity in August of 2017 simultaneously with the construction loan.
Success Description: |-
  The development was delivered on-time and on budget 12 months later and 100% pre-leased.We then refinanced the property on month 18 as part of a long term hold strategy. After refinancing paid back the initial $2m in equity we also received a further $775k in profit on the refinance, in addition to $150k in rent per annum until we sold the property in June of 2021.

  Total build costs were $24.2m and the property was sold to Harrison Street for $44.7m in June of 2021 representing a 85% profit on cost.

  The sale meant that on the $2m equity originally invested, there was a total profit of $3.6m.
